    <div>Problem: This problem was asked by Uber.

        Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product
        of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

        For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input
        was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

        placeholder="input in array form, that is, there is a comma between items. For example: 1,2,3">
