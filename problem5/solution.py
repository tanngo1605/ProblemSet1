#This is a really cool example of using closures to store data. 
# We must look at the signature type of cons to retrieve its first and last elements. cons takes in a and b, and returns a new anonymous function, which itself takes in f, and calls f with a and b. So the input to car and cdr is that anonymous function, which is pair. To get a and b back, we must feed it yet another function, one that takes
#  in two parameters and returns the first (if car) or last (if cdr) one.

def car (pair)
    return pair(lambda a, b:a)

def  cdr(pair)
    return pair(lambda a,b: b)
